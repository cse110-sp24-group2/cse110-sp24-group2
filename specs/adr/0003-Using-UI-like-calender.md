# Decision: Using a UI like a calender

## Context and Problem Statement:
- In our meeting, we're discussing the optimal UI design for our app's initial interface. We're debating between two options: a calendar layout or a list layout. We're considering which would be preferred by our various user personas.
  
## Decision Drivers:

- Calender seems pleasing and it is easy to navigate.
- List: Risked monotony and potential user disengagement, as well as potential navigation difficulties.

## Considered Options:

- We considered if we wanted to inlcude both calender and list but it would overcompicate and it was unnecessary.

## Decision Outcome:
- Selected decision: "Going to use Calender UI"
