# Decision: Using a UI like a calender

## Context and Problem Statement:

- In our meeting, we're discussing the optimal UI design for our app's initial interface. The initial interface would be the first page the user sees, and is used to navigate to individual note entries in the app. We're debating between two options: a calendar layout or a list layout. We're considering which would be preferred by our various user personas.

## Decision Drivers:

- Calender seems pleasing and it is easy to navigate.
- List: Risked monotony and potential user disengagement, as well as potential navigation difficulties.

## Considered Options:

- We considered if we wanted to inlcude both calender and list but it would overcompicate and it was unnecessary.
- Considered showing only a week at a time, deemed that it made navigation to old notes too much of a hassle.

## Decision Outcome:

- Selected decision: "Going to use Calender UI"
