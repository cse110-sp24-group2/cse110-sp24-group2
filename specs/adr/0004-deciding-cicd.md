# Decision: Deciiding Github actions: Jest, Prettier, codacy, Puppeteer, JSDocs

## Context and Problem Statement:
- During our meeting, we were also discussing what do we need to automate. The problem was that not everyone is familar with new and complicated testing frameworks. So, we decided to use between the tools that were taught to us and
the tools that already existed but not taught to use. 
## Decision Drivers:

- Jest: For testing 
- Puppeteer: For unit and end to end testing
- Prettier: For code formatting
- JSDocs: For documenting js code
- Codecy: For identifying and issues early on

## Considered Options:

- Mocha, Jest
- Selenium, Puppeteer
- ESLint
- Docco
- Code climate

## Decision Outcome:
- Selected decision: Using Jest, Prettier, codacy, Puppeteer, JSDocs for GitHub action
