# Decision: Deciding purpose of ToDo List purpose: Long Term, Short Term, Up to the User

### Date: 05/18/2024

### Consulted: Entire Team

## Context and Problem Statement

- We had previously discussed the desire to include a todo list functionality within our code, but did not decide what sort of time frame the list was supposed to cover. To remedy this, we decided to formalize a decision to keep things clearer and better for the user

## Decision Drivers:

- Location of ToDo List, having it on calendar page may be useful
- Most useful to user, what sort of tasks do they need to track
- Necessity for all users, will they need a tool to keep track of the tasks, most likely
- Variability of tasks, what sort of tasks could be included within the list

## Considered Options:

- Long term list, represent work needing to be done over weeks/months
- Short term list, small daily things a dev needed to use
- No implemented list, let them make their own in markdown if desired

## Decision Outcome:

- Selected decision: Long term list

### Expiration:

1 year
