- The app should not take more than 500 MB of space

### User Stories

- As a user, I want my app to load in less than a second so I don't lose my train of thought

### Compatibility - is it compatible with the systems we are building for?

- The app must be compatible with Windows 11 and MacOS
  - Developers keep their devices up to date, so we will target the latest versions

### Usability

- Usability refers to our user's ability to use our app

- Our app satisfies usability numerous different ways

1. Our project makes it easy for our user to use the app. Our user just needs to navigate through our project and create notes whenever needed. It's just a simple process of just clicking on a certain day, typing in notes for that day, saving, working with the todo lists, and exiting the app
2. Our user would only need to perform 6 clicks at minimum when using the app. This includes clicking on a day, clicking on the textbox to enter in notes for that day, clicking save, adding a task to the notes page to do list, and exiting out of the app.
3. Our project also doesn't contain nested menus within dropdowns, everything that the user needs to use our app is right in front of them (adding and deleting journal entries, navigating across different days in the calendar, working with the calendar and notes page to do list)
