## Attendance
- Sent Andy to ask, then discussed with Brian async and entire team during weekly meeting.

## Agenda
- Get feedback on our Definition of Done (DoD) found in our #policy channel
- Get feedback on our Sprint Board on Github Projects


### Definition of Done
- Professor says should add "write your own unit tests before review" to the policy section as part of our Definition of Done
- Developer does first cut of unit tests, then QA does the second cut of tests. Kinda the same for creating documentation
- Can add custom @ tags for JSDocs, ie `@userdocs` and then it'll auto generate more

### Sprint Boards on Github Projects
- Either add tags for each sprint or make a new sprint board for each sprint so TAs can track it
- Have a Sprint Backlog and General Backlog
  - Or do the rebidding process discussed in lecture
- Otherwise looks good
