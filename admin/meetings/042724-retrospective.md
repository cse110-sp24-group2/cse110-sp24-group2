### Notes to remember:
- Name your branch with issue name and number you are working on so that we know what branch is addressing what issue and helps keep track of the issues currently being worked on.

## What everyone said they liked about the project:
1. Impressed by the overall look and design of the Calendar.
2. Glad that the visual appearance of the Calendar was appealing.
3. Everything went smoothly and we did not have any clashes/hiccups in the process.
4. Everyone was able to get involved and contribute to the assignment.
5. Peer review of each other's code was done and comments were very helpful in learning.
6. We were able to incorporate different designs for different months.
7. The page responded as we expected it to be and the backend part was functioning very well.
8. Got us more familiar with dividing the workload and working together.

## Step 1:
Anonymously graded the project on each person's Clarity, Engagement, Autonomy, Mastery, Meaning, and Impact.

- The result observed was pretty much in the middle of everything. 
- The lowest scores observed were in Mastery and Impact as we have only just started learning about them and haven't had much practice.
- There was also a huge range difference in Mastery which can be attributed to the difference in previous experience.
- Overall everyone felt pretty satisfied

## Step 2:
### Start Stop Continue List

Listed Ideas on what we should Start doing, Stop doing, and continue doing in projects. Then grouped them together if they were similar.
