- The result observed was pretty much in the middle of everything. 
- The lowest scores observed were in Mastery as we are only just learning skills required for our task so it is normal to feel lack of mastery in them.
- There was also a huge range difference in Impact which might indicate that some people do not have enought opportunity to work on issues that they find impactful which we should pay attention to in the future.
- Overall everyone felt pretty satisfied
