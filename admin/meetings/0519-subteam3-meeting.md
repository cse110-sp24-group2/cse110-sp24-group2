## Agenda

- Figure out tasks for the week
- Break down the labeling system into components

### Tasks:

- Make the label deletable only by clicking an x icon (instead of the entire label) OR only on double click
- Add a formatter for adding multiple labels (rows, wrapping, maybe flexbox?)
- Make general UI for the filter part of the page
- Move labels from testing page to actual notes page (figure out how to add labels)

### Potential Breakdown of Components

- Indidivdual label tag
- Filter Bar
- Add button & label area / header
