# Adding ESLint to CICD Pipeline

## Problem Statement and Context

- Developers are finding it difficult to resolve and identify Codacy errors
- Codacy takes a while to run/load, making for poor developer experience

## Considered Options

- Disabling Codacy: many of the warnings are valid concerns (not false positives), so not doing this
- Switching Codacy to a new tool that is more clear: Other tools are paid, also considering onboarding time picking up new tool would be hard
- Adding Linters to help developers catch
  - Currently 
  

## Decision Outcome

- Add ESLint to our developer tools
  - Codacy can potentially read ESLint configuration files, syncing expectations between Codacy and Developers
  - Lacked a linter in CICD pipeline before
    - Only had prettier
  - ESLint has a smaller learning curve than an alternative to Codacy
